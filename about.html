    <h1>About The Vanillary</h1>
    <p>This is going to be my own awesome website. At the moment I'm learning to create websites by running through <a href="https://www.theodinproject.com">The Odin Project</a>.</p>
    <p>I've learned to use some tags as well as links and images. As I'm super clever I figured out I can use an image as a link, so see what happens when you click my sick logo.</p>

    <p>I will probably dedicate an entire page to my beautiful girlfriend <a href="./heather.html">Heather Reed</a>!</p>
